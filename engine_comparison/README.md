# Engine Comparison

This is a set of scripts to run A/B testing among different fuzzing engines.


# Usage

From one's local computer, call ` ${FTS}/engine_comparison/begin_experiment`

The most necessary specification is the location of the directory which
specifices the configuration of each fuzzing engine. The location of this
directory should be in `$FENGINE_CONFIG_DIR`
